# 🏨 Hotel Reservation Prediction (MLOps)

This MLOps project predicts whether a hotel reservation will be **honored** or **canceled** using machine learning. It helps improve **revenue management** through smart overbooking decisions, **targeted marketing** for reliable customers, and potential **fraud detection**.

> ⚠️ _Note: This app was deployed on **Google Cloud Run**, with resources like GCP buckets, GCR images, and Cloud Run services—all of which have now been deleted to avoid billing. The app is not currently running online or locally._

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Hotels face frequent last-minute cancellations, leading to loss in revenue and poor resource allocation. This model predicts if a reservation will be canceled, enabling:
- ✅ Overbooking strategies if cancellation risk is high
- ✅ Focused marketing for customers likely to honor bookings
- ✅ Risk flags for potential misuse or fraud

---

## 🧠 ML Approach

- **Model Used:** LightGBM (tuned with RandomizedSearchCV)
- **Feature Selection:** RandomForest feature importance
- **Target Variable:** `booking_status` (0 = Canceled, 1 = Not Canceled)

### 🔢 Features Used

| `avg_price_per_room` | Booking price per room |
| `arrival_month` / `arrival_date` | Stay timing |
| `market_segment_type` | Source of booking |
| `type_of_meal_plan` | Selected meal plan |
| `room_type_reserved` | Room category |
| `no_of_special_requests`, `repeated_guest`, `required_car_parking_space` | Behavioral features |
| _...plus several more_ |
